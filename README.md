So hiiiii and thanks for considering to play my gameeee thank u very much.
So to actually play the game, you have to extract the NotSoFunny.exe file that youll see when you downloaded the game files
Then you just run it, your antivirus may say that thats a virus and stuff BUT, it only says that because the app is not verified and to verify it will cost a lot of money so im srry, so if it DOES say that (and it will) then you just have to whitelist it.
To whitelist something, go to your antivirus settings and find something that says whitelist or smth, then choose file or folder (if youre on windows, idk what to do on linux or other OS's) then choose the folder in which you have the game saved.
Thats it! then when you did all that, you can play the game, im srry its so hard.
